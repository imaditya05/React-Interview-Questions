# Star Rating Platform

Implement a star rating platform where users can rate an item using a star-based system. The platform includes the following features:

* Click to Rate: Clicking a star will turn all stars up to and including that star yellow, representing the userâ€™s rating.
* Hover to Preview: Hovering over a star will temporarily turn all stars up to and including that star yellow, showing a preview of the rating.
* Persisted Rating: Once a star is clicked, the rating remains persistent, even after hovering away.
